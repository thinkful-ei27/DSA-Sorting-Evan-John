## Quick Sort
1. Choose a pivot (can be anything)
2. Create two vars: i and j (set them to beginning)
3. Compare i with pivot.
4. If i is greater than pivot, move i forward 1
5. If i is less than pivot, swap the values of i and j. then move j forward 1
6. If we get to the end, we swap the pivot with j

## Merge Sort
1. Pick the middle
2. Split left, and Split right until 1 element
3. Start comparing splits based on index 0 of the arrays
4. Recursively build new arrays from the mini sorted arrays
